ï»¿i need to create a web page that user can say a
car make/model and specs including name brands and sizes.
after entering make/model/spec ai will find info and populate drop down menus of parts available from "DriftHQ" 
or other known car aftermarket manufacturers for that vehicle stock and aftermarket appear
drop down menus of , optional, with brand name engine, drivetrain, arb, springs, dampers, driveshafts, rotars, Calipers, suspension kits from stock up to wisefab 70 degree steering max, tyre size, rim size


ai finds those specs 
converts info to metric to use later when filling in the .ini files needed.
with those specs 
creates an engine.ini based off a file default matching the below blueprint of an engine.ini to best of ability for realism. !do not change
